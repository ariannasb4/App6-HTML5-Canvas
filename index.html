Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is to create a canvas and underneath it have functioning buttons that, on the canvas, draws a rectangle, writes my name, loads an image, 
and a button that clears everything on the canvas.

Known Issues:
Issues that I had included overall trying to make the buttons work and getting my name to be displayed where it's not covered by the rectangle. Also, there
was a point where the image would not be displayed when the button was clicked and coding it through it's URL, so I needed to download the image 
and code it based of it being downloaded.
